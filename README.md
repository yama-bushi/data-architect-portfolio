# Justin Lowe – Data & Cloud Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This is a portfolio of my work in data engineering, cloud architecture, and applied machine learning.  
Here you’ll find project examples demonstrating my skills in building modern, scalable, and automated data platforms across AWS, GCP, and Snowflake, as well as my applied research in financial markets and forecasting.

## Project Synopses

### 1. AWS Snowflake Ingestion Framework
A metadata-driven ingestion system using Snowflake external tables, dynamic table/procedure creation, and automation for scalable data onboarding. Demonstrates automation, DDL/DML scripting, and cloud data warehousing.

### 2. GCP BigQuery Ingestion Framework
Much like the AWS ingestion framework with some key improvements. A parameterized framework for automating table and pipeline creation in BigQuery. Uses dynamic SQL and metadata management to enable rapid, scalable schema evolution and upsert logic—ideal for enterprise ingestion and ETL teams.

### 3. Cloud Financial ARIMA & Vision ML Exploration
End-to-end pipeline for ingesting crypto time series into GCP (Cloud Storage, BigQuery), with automated feature engineering, chart generation, and ML experiments (including BigQuery ARIMA forecasting and chart image recognition).

### 4. Financial Markets ML Research (Demo)
A modular, research-safe codebase for demonstrating time series modeling, feature engineering, parameter optimization, and (simulated) strategy backtesting using Python and standard ML libraries—no proprietary logic or live signals.

### 5. Provider Utilization Forecasting
Production-style forecasting workflow for healthcare/education provider networks. Includes BigQuery SQL and Python regression for modeling provider-specific utilization trends, leveraging ARIMA and custom regression adjustments.
